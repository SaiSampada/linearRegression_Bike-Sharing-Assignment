# linearRegression_Bike-Sharing-Assignment

This repository contains a predictive model to forecast the demand for shared bikes for BoomBikes, a bike-sharing service provider. The goal of the model is to understand the factors influencing the demand for bikes in the American market, helping BoomBikes improve its business strategy and cater to customer needs efficiently as the economy recovers post-COVID-19 lockdowns.

Problem Statement: 
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has faced significant revenue declines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To prepare for a rebound in demand once the quarantine ends, BoomBikes has hired a consulting company to analyze factors influencing the demand for shared bikes. 

The company aims to:
Identify significant variables in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
Understand how these variables describe bike demand trends.
Use the model to adjust business strategies for future market conditions.

Business Goal:
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the demand for shared bikes based on independent variables such as weather conditions, time of the year, and other socio-economic factors. The model will be an essential tool for BoomBikes management to make data-driven decisions in adapting to demand fluctuations and better serve customers.

## Key Insights from the Model

1. **Seasonal Trends**:
   - Bike demand tends to increase during **summer** and **winter** seasons, likely due to favorable weather conditions, holiday travel, or specific seasonal activities.
   - **August** and **September** see a noticeable rise in bike rentals, which can be attributed to pleasant weather and end-of-summer activities.

2. **Weather Impact**:
   - **Temperature** plays a crucial role in boosting bike demand, with warmer weather encouraging more people to rent bikes.
   - **Windspeed** and **adverse weather conditions** (like **rain** or **thunderstorms**) significantly reduce bike demand, as people are less likely to rent bikes in windy or rainy conditions.
   - **Cloudy** or **misty conditions** also negatively affect bike usage, suggesting that people prefer biking when the weather is clear and pleasant.

3. **Time of Week**:
   - Demand for bikes is typically lower on **Sundays**, likely due to reduced commuting or fewer people using bikes for leisure on weekends.

4. **Holiday Impact**:
   - Bike demand tends to decrease on **holidays**, possibly due to lower commuting, vacationing, or altered usage patterns during festive periods.

5. **Monthly Trends**:
   - **Winter months** like **December**, **February**, and **January** generally see a drop in bike demand due to colder weather, which discourages outdoor activities and bike rentals.

6. **Yearly Trends**:
   - The demand for bikes showed an upward trend in recent years, indicating growing popularity of bike-sharing services, particularly in urban areas, and an increase in customer adoption.
