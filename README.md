# linearRegression_Bike-Sharing-Assignment

This repository contains a predictive model to forecast the demand for shared bikes for BoomBikes, a bike-sharing service provider. The goal of the model is to understand the factors influencing the demand for bikes in the American market, helping BoomBikes improve its business strategy and cater to customer needs efficiently as the economy recovers post-COVID-19 lockdowns.

Problem Statement
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has faced significant revenue declines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To prepare for a rebound in demand once the quarantine ends, BoomBikes has hired a consulting company to analyze factors influencing the demand for shared bikes. 
The company aims to:
Identify significant variables in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
Understand how these variables describe bike demand trends.
Use the model to adjust business strategies for future market conditions.

Business Goal
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the demand for shared bikes based on independent variables such as weather conditions, time of the year, and other socio-economic factors. The model will be an essential tool for BoomBikes management to make data-driven decisions in adapting to demand fluctuations and better serve customers.
